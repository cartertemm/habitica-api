# Habitica API interface in Python

## Getting started

Before you start you'll need your Habitica User ID and API Token, found in the API section of the user settings page on habitica.com.

If you created your account using either Apple or Google based authentication, it will be necessary to add a local login method. To do this:

* Open your Habitica dashboard in a web browser.
* Click on User -> Settings
* Under Registration, enter a display name, email address and password into the "add local authentication" form

It is probably a good idea to include these steps in any apps or scripts you intend to destribute on top of this module, as it is not likely that Google authentication will be made available.

## Installation

For now, clone this repository and run

```
python setup.py install
```

More examples, guides and information will be made available soon!
